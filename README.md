# Modeling Customer Behavior to Predict Repeat Purchase

This project delivers an advanced analytical framework for understanding customer behavior and predicting repeat purchases, enabling businesses to enhance decision-making and boost key metrics.

## Project Relevance
In today's competitive landscape, this solution provides businesses with:
- Deep customer insights through behavioral segmentation
- Predictive capabilities for repeat purchases
- Data-driven strategies for sales optimization
- Adaptable methodology for various business domains

**Novelty**: Adapts existing methods of analyzing customer behavior to the specifics of the data presented.

## Key Results
1. **Customer Segmentation** using:
   - K-means clustering
   - Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
   - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
   - Hierarchical clustering on RFM risk-segment
   
2. **Market Basket Analysis**:
   - Identification of popular product bundles
   - Association rule mining for purchase prediction
   - Segment-specific recommendation strategies

**Applications**: Retail, e-commerce, and any customer-centric business seeking to predict behavior and increase sales.
